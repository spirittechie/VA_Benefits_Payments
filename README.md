# VA Disability Payment Calendar (2026)
This repository provides `.ics` calendar files for VA disability payments in 2026, including both the **official VA payment schedule** and an **adjusted early deposit version** for those who receive funds a day earlier.

## 📌 About
Many veterans receive their VA disability payments on a different schedule depending on their financial institution. Some credit unions and online banks process payments **one or more days early**. This repository includes two `.ics` calendar files:

1. **VA_Standard.ics** - The standard VA disability payment dates.
2. **VA_EarlyDeposit_1Day.ics** - Adjusted payment dates for those who receive funds **one day early**.

Future updates may include **customized versions** for institutions that release funds **two or three days early**, based on community feedback.

, while others like USAA or NFCU may hit 3-4 days if the official date falls near a weekend/holiday
